DAWNShield is a decentralized AI privacy firewall designed to run on the DAWN Black Box. It combines a self-hosted VPN, an AI-powered firewall, and optional decentralized threat sharing on Solana. The app transforms the Black Box into a cypherpunk privacy hub, providing users full control over their internet security and privacy.
